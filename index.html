<p>Last month we ran our first visualization challenge. And, boy, did you peeps really rise to it.</p>
<p>And here’s our second challenge: <strong>MON€Y PANIC$!</strong></p>
<p>The financial system, debt crises, recession fears, Wall St occupation, currency devaluation, collapse of the markets, the END OF THE WORLD! It’s all getting rather mind-boggling.</p>
<p>So we and the Guardian have found some juicy datasets we want you to use to explain what in the world is going on. Clearly. Understandably. Visibly.</p>
<p>Top prize is <strong>$2000</strong> for a full design. Non-designers can win <strong>$1000</strong> in our sketch-based napkin comp. All winners will feature on the Guardian Datablog.</p>
<p>We might add an interactive/motion-graphics string this time if we get enough entries.</p>
<p>All the info – <strong>dates, rules, guidelines, entry details</strong> – is over on the Information is Beautiful Awards site.</p>
<p>Now go show Gordon Gecko what you got. (You can take lunch, though.)</p>

<p><strong>A visualization of complementary flavours by David McCandless and Willow Tyrer.</strong></p>
<p>All food tastes amazing, just sometimes not together.</p>
<p>So we roved around 1000 recipes for common flavour patterns and visualized the results.</p>
<p>A good way to build a meal, maybe, if you lack a chef’s intuitive buds. Less data visualization, more dinner visualization. <strong>An infoodgraphic</strong>, perhaps. Ok, we’ll stop now.</p>
<p>These were created back in 2009 for the Information Is Beautiful book. Willow, a Swedish infographic designer, came up with an elegant, organic style. We thought it might be nice to release them into the wild.</p>
<p>Enjoy your meal.</p>

<p><strong>The Information Is Beautiful Awards</strong>, in fact.</p>
<p>The idea is to reward practitioners, big and small, from anywhere in the world. And to celebrate, honour and generally trumpet great work and great contributions to this exciting and growing field.</p>
<p>Thanks to a generous sponsor, Kantar, we can run it as a non-profit venture and hand out decent-sized cash prizes to winners.</p>
<p>Also, excitingly, every month, we’ll be running visualisation challenges so everyone can have a chance to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Pop over and take a look. Tell us what you think.</strong></p>
<p>You can follow our awards on Twitter, too.</p>

<p>We were curious about how people perceive their ‘souls’. Hell, we could even maybe visualize a taxonomy of souls?</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ve had loads of entries. Loads. Such lovely ones, too. And in this case, more is more.</p>
<p>So feel free to send us your hand-drawn soul. Which can mean your self, your personality, your insides, however you see your you. Just follow the instructions below and be part of the mass.</p>
<div>
<hr>
<h1>DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<p><span id="more-3599"></span> <strong>Here’s what to do</strong><br> Please draw your soul on white paper with a black or dark pen. (Although colour is okay too, if you feel you really need it.) Then scan, webcam or photo it and upload it to:<br><strong>InformationIsSoulful AT Gmail</strong></p>
<p>(You can also draw on the computer if you really want. Though I think hand-drawn might be more…soulful?)</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br> : Create a moment for yourself to do it.<br> : Be expressive.<br> : Don’t think about it too much. Just draw whatever comes to mind. 1st drafts are good.<br> : It can be as simple or as complex as you like<br> : IMPORTANT: Please mark your picture in one corner to indicate whether you are male (M), female (F) or transgender (T).</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong><br> If you’re webcamming or photo’ing, please use a flash or good lighting. Ideally it’ll be pretty much in focus. And filling the frame with the minimum of creases and crinkles.</p>
<p><strong>Credits &amp; Anonymity</strong><br> If you’re happy for your name to appear in the credit lists of any resulting image, please write words like ‘HAPPY TO BE CREDITED’ in your email. Otherwise, we will treat your submission as anonymous. (If you want to be fully anonymous, you can use yousendit.com.)<br><strong></strong></p>
<p>That email address is: InformationIsSoulful AT Gmail</p>

<p>We’ve launched a series of monthly visualization competitions They’ll run alongside our shiny new annual Information is Beautiful Awards.</p>
<p>First challenge: <strong>visualize data on the world’s non-renewable resources</strong>. Specifically, how long they might last.</p>
<p>I had a page on this in my book. But I’ve never been entirely happy with it. Can you do better?</p>
<p>If so, you could bag <strong>$2,000</strong> for a design. That’s chunky.</p>
<p>And don’t worry if you can’t design. If you’ve got a brain and a pencil but no design skillz, you can still submit a sketch of your idea. There’s <strong>$1,000</strong> prize for such “napkin” entries.</p>
<p>Yeah. Everyone can make information beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>“Talk To Me”</strong>, curated by the legendary Paola Antonelli, explores how innovations in communication design are transforming our lives. It features interactive objects, data visualizations, and brain-blending guerilla tech projects.</p>
<p>The Hierarchy Of Digital Distractions explores and visualizes the subtle, invisible structure I use to prioritize one digital distraction over another. Check out its page on MoMA and press some buttons.  (if you tweet, use #ttmhierarchy).</p>
<h1>limited edition prints</h1>
<p>To celebrate, I’ve created a batch limited edition prints. Oh man – they’re gorgeous.</p>
<p>I thought it would be ironic to render such a technological-themed viz with the really old-school “risograph” print technique. It produces a really grainy, smudgy, soulful ‘old-school’ look. (Thanks to HatoPress in London for their awesomely detailed work).</p>
<p>Look at that!<br><img src="hdd_blur_closeup2_550.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Of Digital Distractions - David McCandless - Limited edition prints"><br> (They’re also super eco-friendly: printed on recycled art paper with soy-based inks.)</p>
